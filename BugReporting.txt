Preconditions: Service http://localhost:9000/api is started
 
Steps:
1. User sends POST request to http://localhost:9000/api/books with certain body, for example:
 {
    "Id": 1,
    "Author": "testAuthor1",
    "Title": "Title1",
    "Description": "nice book 1"
}
2. User sends GET request to http://localhost:9000/api/books?id=1 in order to observe the response.

Result: Response is 200, but response body is:
    {
        "Id": 1,
        "Title": "Title1",
        "Description": "nice book 1",
        "Author": null
    }
"Author": null is not correct;

Expected result: Response shoulde be 200 but "Author" should be with value "testAuthor1", not null - "Author": "testAuthor1";
Response body: 
{
    "Id": 1,
    "Author": "testAuthor1",
    "Title": "Title1",
    "Description": "nice book 1"
}
